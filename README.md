# Fake Coursebook

[Fakecoursebook](http://fakecoursebook.info) is a course information query tool for UTD students that is more usable than [UTD's CourseBook](https://coursebook.utdallas.edu/).

* Provide higher query response speed, a simple and efficient UI, and more convenient ways to query and links and sortable results.

* Visualize the semester data for the past decade and make full use of historical data to present more comprehensive and valuable information, implemented by [ECharts](https://echarts.apache.org/).
